# ComputerNetworks_Project1

This project connects to a server, sends a message to the server, and logs the reply from the server.

The project code is written in python3 and uses the socket library.

To execute the program, call python3 and pass the name of the script (projectCode.py).

The user must input the host IP address, the port number, and the log file location. The format of the data entered should be separated by commas with no spaces, such as: 34.173.12.133,3389,logFile.txt

If the connection is successful, the program will prompt the user to input a message to send to the server. Send the message "network" to receive a message in return.
